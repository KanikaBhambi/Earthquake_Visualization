## Visualization of the GeoJSON Earthquake data

-The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats that is updated every 5 minutes. Using the USGS GeoJSON Feed page we can pick a data set to visualize; the last hour, the past day, the past 7 days and the past 30 days.

-I used the GeoJSON link for the last 7 days of earthquake data and JavaScript to map the data along with fault lines in Leaflet
